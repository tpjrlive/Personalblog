        <p>Hello! I'm Thomas Pizzo Jr. I have a diverse background that includes being a Division 1 hockey player, a NASCAR tire changer, and a business owner. Here's a little more about me:</p>

            <h2>NASCAR Tire Changer</h2>
            <p>After my hockey career, I transitioned to working as a tire changer for NASCAR. This job required quick thinking, agility, and precision under pressure.</p>

            <h2>Business Owner</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am the owner of Roc Your Event, a photo booth business. We focus on creating memorable experiences for our clients at various events such as weddings, proms, and corporate gatherings. Our goal is to reach 175 bookings, and we are well on our way with around 93 bookings currently.</p>

            <h2>AI Research</h2>
