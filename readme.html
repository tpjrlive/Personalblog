<h1> 9:29 AM 12/18/2020: I forgot how Important it was to move my body </h1>

<p> Last night I felt inspired to pick up the ol' kettlebell and put in some physical work. I forgot how
important it was for me to physcially move my body. There's a person I follow on instagram who speaks
about celebrating your bodies ability to move. That really sunk in deep with me when I heard it and I wanted
to get in some work to honor myself. I've prioritized getting healthier many times through my life. It is
very much like a rollercoaster...I do well sometimes and other times I am a complete disaster. I'm sure some of
you can relate to that. At this moment in time, I definitley feel a bit heavier weight wise than I would like.
I am weiging around 217. To put that in perspective, when I was playing hockey and working out so much I was around
180-185. Not that the number is an indicator of overall health but it's one measurement we can use. I don't think
I have more muscle on my frame than fat so there's that, lol. I just want to look in the mirror and like what
I see. I want to really develop that appreication and love for myself that I've never really had in my life.
I think it starts with honoring yourself and working every single day on the relationship you have with 
yourself. For example, I've promised myself to drink a gallon of water a day as one habit for my health. I 
haven't worked on eating better or exercising every day or whatever. I'm just tackling that one habit and
keeping the promise to myself. It's been 10 days and I genuinely feel different. Yes, the water probably has
something to do with it from a biological standpoint. But I'm arguing that the act of keeping the promise to myself
has even more weight to it phsycologically. I am honoring myself. And it feels so damn good.  </p>


<h1> 11:34 PM 12/16/2020: First Week Starting a New Full-Time Job at loanDepot. </h1>

<p> Good Wednesday Evening! It's been a pretty busy week so far as I've officially started my new full-time
position with loanDepot as a Direct Loan Processor III on 12-13-2020. I've had a blast so far getting up to speed.
I'm not going to be able to share much about my time here at loanDepot as most stuff learned will be confidential
to the company. I primarily will be dealing with analzying mortgage loans which involves a high degree of personal 
information for borrowers. I really do enjoy the analytical nature of processing mortgage loans so I look forward to growing in the 
industry. LoanDepot has invested a tremendous amount of money in their technology which is something I'm obviously 
very passionate about. In one of their intro training videos they regarded themselves as a "Fintech" company which 
I thought was super interesting. So there it is, I now work for a "Fintech" company. I like the sounds of that
as it aligns nicely with my desire to become a technologist of some sorts in the future. 
Technology has always been a passion of mine. It means a lot for me to be aligned with a company who shares in that passion. I will be sure to keep you
updated with maybe some wins that I can talk about and more importantly maybe even a few losses that will serve as
an opportunity to learn/grow as a professional. Let's be honest in that this stream is going to be mostly dedicated
to going through hobby projects like the Learning Web Design book so that I can develop my blog/site from scratch for free.</p>


<h1>6:12 PM 12/13/2020: Introducing the New Daily/weekly/whenever blog</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome! I'm so excited to get back into writing and logging my thoughts.
It was all the way back in 2010 when I started my first wordpress blog called Battleformydream.com.<br>


This site was dedicated to helping me achieve my dream of playing professional hockey. At the time, I was a
recruited walk-on at Clarkson University and that was a serious goal of mine. Battleformydream.com was a place
for me to tell stories about other inspiring individuals to selfishly help my mindset/motivation towards
accomplishing the goal I set forth for myself.<br>

I can't believe that was over a decade ago. I remember traveling down to Long Island for an internship after my
sopohmore year of college. The 2010 Worldcup was happening that year so it was an electric place to be for that.<br>

It was with a company called Honorverus Research. I can be completely candid and say that I didn't really learn a 
whole lot with the actual internship. I felt like the big win was doing all the research/setup of my very first blog
that was through wordpress/godaddy. It was so much fun building that site even if it was just a templated blog.<br> 

I would lose hours going down different rabbit holes figuring things out about the site or how to fix something on it.

Recently, I wanted to rededicate myself to picking up Rob Muhlestein's Beginner Boost which helps aspiring technologists
receive the foundational skills needed to get started in the industry. I am also transitioning to a new day job as a 
mortgage loan processor at LoanDepot so I will be balancing a lot in the coming weeks. This basic HTML doc will serve
as the running log of thoughts/ideas/progress/wins/losses while I go through it.<br> 

One of the books he recommends for beginning Technologists is <em>Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics 5th Edition by Jennifer Robbins.</em><br>

I will be working through this book first. This blog will be a running experimentation log of that journey as well.</p>
