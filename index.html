        <h1>Welcome to Dreams and Realities</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Welcome to Dreams and Realities, a blog where I share my journey, experiences, and insights from a life dedicated to pursuing passions and overcoming challenges.</strong>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Thomas Pizzo Jr., and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the internet. My journey has been anything but ordinary, and through this blog, I hope to inspire and connect with those who share a passion for growth, resilience, and innovation.
        </p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <h3>Division 1 Hockey Player</h3>
        <p>
            My story began on the ice, where I played Division 1 hockey at Clarkson University. The discipline, teamwork, and perseverance I developed during my hockey career have been the foundation of my approach to life and work. You can read more about my hockey career on my <a href="https://clarksonathletics.com/sports/mens-ice-hockey/roster/tom-pizzo/2723" target="_blank">Clarkson University bio</a>.

        <h3>NASCAR Tire Changer</h3>
        <p>
            After hanging up my skates, I transitioned to the fast-paced world of NASCAR, working as a tire changer. This role required quick thinking, agility, and precision under pressure, skills that have proven invaluable in all my subsequent endeavors.
        </p>

        <h3>Business Co-owner</h3>
        <p>
            Today, I am the co-owner of Roc Your Event, a photo booth business that creates memorable experiences at various events such as weddings, proms, and corporate gatherings. Utilizing the CMSMax platform, I handle all website changes, SEO implementation strategies, and content improvements, driving significant growth and engagement for our business.
        </p>

        <h2>Embracing AI and Technology</h2>
        <p>
            My passion for technology led me to start Digitalfacture Inc., an AI research company dedicated to helping small businesses incorporate AI into their everyday workflows to save time and money. We are committed to ensuring that AI can directly impact profitability for small businesses, allowing them to stay relevant in an ever-changing market.

        <h3>AI-Powered Social Media Post Generator</h3>
        <p>
            One of my notable projects is a social media post generator using the Chat-GPT4 model. Built with a custom widget on Duda and utilizing Replit for server-side JavaScript, this tool helps create engaging social media posts while keeping content under recommended character limits. Key features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to iterate on generated posts while maintaining the essence of the original content.</li>
            <li>Options to clear the form.</li>
            <li>The ability to copy each post individually or both posts at once.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Currently Learning</h3>
        <p>
            I am continuously expanding my knowledge and skills, currently diving into AI and Machine Learning, JavaScript and Web Development, Git, VI, Linux, and the GPT-4 API.
