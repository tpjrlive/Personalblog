<h1> Wed Dec 30 20:25:36 EST 2020: Free Pro Membership for Canva.com if you are a non Profit </h1>

<p> This is an amazing deal that <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a> Is doing. They are offering a membership to their pro level if you are legitimate Non-Profit.
Our buddy James Norris with Handicapable Fitness was able to get approved for a Canva Pro membership. Great news for him and any other non-profits who had 
no idea about this. It truly is changing the graphic design game for entry level people getting into making designs for social media.
You can check out all the details at this link and apply for the program <a href="https://support.canva.com/account-basics/nonprofit-program/apply-for-nonprofit/">here</a>.

<h1> Tue Dec 29 23:31:29 EST 2020: Documentating a 30 minute stretch </h1>

<p> It always seems fitting to incorporate some sort of new physical goal when jumping into the new year. After 33 years, I know better than to make some grand new year new me plan for world health domination.
The number of times I've set up a goal and haven't reached it is laughable. It's like a running tape of how many times I've tried and haven't succeeded. It's just a constant little reminder always
letting me know how many times I've fell short. These are the sort of things I have to continually fight back against. I have to hold myself accountable to an optimistic plan for personal growth.
I cannot let the past failures dictate my aspirations for the future. I'm taking this advice for myself. It's one of the major reasons I work with a coach every week for developing my self esteem.
I'm not immune to feeling inadequate, or letting the destroyers of men into my brain. "I'm not worthy and I'm not enough" are just a few things that seem to find themselves into my thought process.
Well tonight, I just did a little 30 minute static stretch to help offset all the hours spent sitting in a chair now that I'm working remotely 100%. I try to take frequent standing and walking breaks.
I will tell you that my hips have never felt this stiff. It's a clear indicator I need to spend more time stretching everything out. Hope you all had a great Tuesday. Take care.

<h1> Tue Dec 29 09:47:30 EST 2020: Analyzing The National Association of Mortgage Processors (<a href="https://www.mortgageprocessor.org/">NAMP</a>) </h1>

<p> The first thing I did when I was struggling in my new career as a mortgage processor was jump on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">duckduckgo</a> and do a search for 
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mortgage+processing+certification&t=h_&ia=web">Mortgage Processing certification</a>. I was 60 days into the career, I could not believe that they are charging what they for 
their certification course. It's around $995 to get certified as a Master Loan Processor. After further digging on their webiste, it's clear that they are a "for profit" corporation...but their
URL ends in a .org which is normally reserved for non profit corporations. It's alarming the cost they are charging for knowledge that is generally gained through on the job 
experience. After watching so much content from Rob at Skilstak and what he is trying to do with his Association of Federated Knowledge Workers it is becoming clear to me that the 
mortgage industry is really ripe for a legitimate free resource for gaining knowledge as a mortgage processor. What we have seen in 2020 is a short supply of mortgage operations professionals
judging by the amount of recruiters reaching out to me after 10 months in the industry. I was able to increase my base hourly salary by 20,000 and increase my monthly bonus structure by moving 
companies. I am also working completely remote now. It's such a good lesson to gain in learning skills that are relevant to the overall macro trends. It's why I'm so passionate about becoming
a technologist. I can see the same exact thing happening once I am good enough to get paid to gig with tech skills. I have a feeling I have enough skills to gig now but I really want to get some
more time and practice in before really trying to get paid to do tech gigs. I think I've convinced myself that I need to start producing original content targeted to mortgage processors. 
It's a delicate area but I don't want to be on the hook for any sort of copyright infringement but the knowledge I have now in my head is my own and what I do with it is my choice. I need
to do some more research because of the private nature of the business. I look forward to bringing you more resources and knowledge for processers who may be just getting into the industry.

<h1> Sat Dec 26 17:34:44 EST 2020: There's No such thing as small steps </h1>

<p> Had a really good chat with my good buddy James Norris with Handicapable
	fitness. We talked about all things marketing and next steps for his non-profit Handicapable fitness.

<h1> Wed Dec 23 23:54:16 EST 2020 </h1>

<p> "You only get one stab at life and your programmed to value money more than life. Debt or no, today is the first day of the rest of your life and you should get out and explore and do what makes you happy. 
	So many people our age get caught up in the rat race and forget to live and once they are a bit older and "retire" they have reached an age that limits them physically."
	This was a quote that resonated with me from a buddy of mine who I used to race with. He was a guy that always shot me straight and told me how it was. It's a rarity that people do that these days.
	I had a really good talk tonight with Reece Mcneil who is my coach for the relationship I have with myself. I know it sounds a little funny. Why do I need to work on the relationship 
	with myself? It just goes to show you we can always improve and strive to be the best version of ourselves. We talked about making progress towards layering habits/promises with myself.
	I've been super consistent with drinking a gallon of water a day. I had a little bump in the road a few weeks ago where I didn't have the water to drink ( we were getting a new water filter)
	And I ended up not keeping the promise I had with myself. This led me to believe that preparation really is so important. We spoke about getting repetitions with posting more content. It
	made me make the analogy of the water bottle. Maybe I'm just not prepared with my 7 jugs of water. I want to download 7 pieces of content on Sunday to post for the week. This is the new 
	promise I have with myself. Let's go!!

<h1> 11:51 PM 12/21/2020: Doing work that changes lives. </h1>

<p> I am always blown away at some of the nuggets of wisdom I receive on a daily basis from being involved with James, Reece and Eric. Eric made a video the other
day that really made me sit back and think about the work these three individuals are doing to help save the lives of so many different people. He made a quick video about what I bring to the table and it really was emotional for me. He mentioned that I help people live the lives they dream of. Helping someone to start their business or dream. Live the life they have always wanted. Go on vacation when they want. Live on their own time. While I genuinely don't believe that's exactly where I'm at this is precisely the vision I have for what my business can help people do. I so badly want to be able to empower individuals to build the bricks of their digital empire. I believe this is what makes everyone truly able to live the life they want. Another aspect of that is financial stability and independance. I so badly want to shout out so loud that it's so vitally important to be on a plan to get out of debt as fast as humanely possible. I even question how badly do I want to be out of debt when I still get starbucks so much or eat out as much as I do. I really really want to get serious as I can almost taste the debtfree coming at the end of this year (2020). I think this puts you in a position to chase after what you truly want to do in life. You really need to liberate yourself from any outside obligation in order to free up your brain to focus on your dreams in all aspects of your life. You can't do this wholeheartadly when you're over your head in DEBT.</p>

<h1> 9:29 AM 12/18/2020: I forgot how Important it was to move my body </h1>

<p> Last night I felt inspired to pick up the ol' kettlebell and put in some physical work. I forgot how
important it was for me to physcially move my body. There's a person I follow on instagram who speaks
about celebrating your bodies ability to move. That really sunk in deep with me when I heard it and I wanted
to get in some work to honor myself. I've prioritized getting healthier many times through my life. It is
very much like a rollercoaster...I do well sometimes and other times I am a complete disaster. I'm sure some of
you can relate to that. At this moment in time, I definitley feel a bit heavier weight wise than I would like.
I am weiging around 217. To put that in perspective, when I was playing hockey and working out so much I was around
180-185. Not that the number is an indicator of overall health but it's one measurement we can use. I don't think
I have more muscle on my frame than fat so there's that, lol. I just want to look in the mirror and like what
I see. I want to really develop that appreication and love for myself that I've never really had in my life.
I think it starts with honoring yourself and working every single day on the relationship you have with 
yourself. For example, I've promised myself to drink a gallon of water a day as one habit for my health. I 
haven't worked on eating better or exercising every day or whatever. I'm just tackling that one habit and
keeping the promise to myself. It's been 10 days and I genuinely feel different. Yes, the water probably has
something to do with it from a biological standpoint. But I'm arguing that the act of keeping the promise to myself
has even more weight to it phsycologically. I am honoring myself. And it feels so damn good.  </p>


<h1> 11:34 PM 12/16/2020: First Week Starting a New Full-Time Job at loanDepot. </h1>

<p> Good Wednesday Evening! It's been a pretty busy week so far as I've officially started my new full-time
position with loanDepot as a Direct Loan Processor III on 12-13-2020. I've had a blast so far getting up to speed.
I'm not going to be able to share much about my time here at loanDepot as most stuff learned will be confidential
to the company. I primarily will be dealing with analzying mortgage loans which involves a high degree of personal 
information for borrowers. I really do enjoy the analytical nature of processing mortgage loans so I look forward to growing in the 
industry. LoanDepot has invested a tremendous amount of money in their technology which is something I'm obviously 
very passionate about. In one of their intro training videos they regarded themselves as a "Fintech" company which 
I thought was super interesting. So there it is, I now work for a "Fintech" company. I like the sounds of that
as it aligns nicely with my desire to become a technologist of some sorts in the future. 
Technology has always been a passion of mine. It means a lot for me to be aligned with a company who shares in that passion. I will be sure to keep you
updated with maybe some wins that I can talk about and more importantly maybe even a few losses that will serve as
an opportunity to learn/grow as a professional. Let's be honest in that this stream is going to be mostly dedicated
to going through hobby projects like the Learning Web Design book so that I can develop my blog/site from scratch for free.</p>


<h1>6:12 PM 12/13/2020: Introducing the New Daily/weekly/whenever blog</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome! I'm so excited to get back into writing and logging my thoughts.
It was all the way back in 2010 when I started my first wordpress blog called Battleformydream.com.<br>


This site was dedicated to helping me achieve my dream of playing professional hockey. At the time, I was a
recruited walk-on at Clarkson University and that was a serious goal of mine. Battleformydream.com was a place
for me to tell stories about other inspiring individuals to selfishly help my mindset/motivation towards
accomplishing the goal I set forth for myself.<br>

I can't believe that was over a decade ago. I remember traveling down to Long Island for an internship after my
sopohmore year of college. The 2010 Worldcup was happening that year so it was an electric place to be for that.<br>

It was with a company called Honorverus Research. I can be completely candid and say that I didn't really learn a 
whole lot with the actual internship. I felt like the big win was doing all the research/setup of my very first blog
that was through wordpress/godaddy. It was so much fun building that site even if it was just a templated blog.<br> 

I would lose hours going down different rabbit holes figuring things out about the site or how to fix something on it.

Recently, I wanted to rededicate myself to picking up Rob Muhlestein's Beginner Boost which helps aspiring technologists
receive the foundational skills needed to get started in the industry. I am also transitioning to a new day job as a 
mortgage loan processor at LoanDepot so I will be balancing a lot in the coming weeks. This basic HTML doc will serve
as the running log of thoughts/ideas/progress/wins/losses while I go through it.<br> 

One of the books he recommends for beginning Technologists is <em>Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics 5th Edition by Jennifer Robbins.</em><br>

I will be working through this book first. This blog will be a running experimentation log of that journey as well.</p>
