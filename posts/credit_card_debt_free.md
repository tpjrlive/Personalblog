# Mon Jan 4 15:49:23 EST 2021: I'm currently Credit Card Debt Free : A Snapshot at my finances :)

I wanted to document a big hurdle I crossed over today as I have finally become credit card debt free.
I've paid off $20,970 in credit cards since 1-1-2019. I feel like I should have paid these off quicker
but I'm grateful that I'm there now. I was really serious about it this year and finally crossed over the 
hurdle. The only debt right now that's charging me interest in my one student loan that 
is around 21,248. The other student loan is a federal loan on deferrment. The only other two debts are a final lease
termination balance of 3,243 which should be knocked out by the end of the month.
