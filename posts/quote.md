"You only get one stab at life and your programmed to value money more than life. Debt or no, today is the first day of the rest of your life and you should get out and explore and do what makes you happy. 
So many people our age get caught up in the rat race and forget to live and once they are a bit older and "retire" they have reached an age that limits them physically."
This was a quote that resonated with me from a buddy of mine who I used to race with. He was a guy that always shot me straight and told me how it was. It's a rarity that people do that these days.
I had a really good talk tonight with Reece Mcneil who is my coach for the relationship I have with myself. I know it sounds a little funny. Why do I need to work on the relationship 
with myself? It just goes to show you we can always improve and strive to be the best version of ourselves. We talked about making progress towards layering habits/promises with myself.
I've been super consistent with drinking a gallon of water a day. I had a little bump in the road a few weeks ago where I didn't have the water to drink ( we were getting a new water filter)
And I ended up not keeping the promise I had with myself. This led me to believe that preparation really is so important. We spoke about getting repetitions with posting more content. It
made me make the analogy of the water bottle. Maybe I'm just not prepared with my 7 jugs of water. I want to download 7 pieces of content on Sunday to post for the week. This is the new 
promise I have with myself. Let's go!!
