# Tue Dec 29 09:47:30 EST 2020: Analyzing The National Association of Mortgage Processors ([NAMP](https://www.mortgageprocessor.org/))

The first thing I did when I was struggling in my new career as a mortgage processor was jump on [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and do a search for 
[mortgage processing certification](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mortgage+processing+certification&t=h_&ia=web). I was 60 days into the career, I could not believe that they are charging what they for 
their certification course. It's around $995 to get certified as a Master Loan Processor. After further digging on their website, it's clear that they are a "for profit" corporation...but their
URL ends in a .org which is normally reserved for non profit corporations. It's alarming the cost they are charging for knowledge that is generally gained through on the job 
experience. After watching so much content from Rob at Skilstak and what he is trying to do with his Association of Federated Knowledge Workers it is becoming clear to me that the 
mortgage industry is really ripe for a legitimate free resource for gaining knowledge as a mortgage processor. What we have seen in 2020 is a short supply of mortgage operations professionals
judging by the amount of recruiters reaching out to me after 10 months in the industry. I was able to increase my base hourly salary by 20,000 and increase my monthly bonus structure by moving 
companies. I am also working completely remote now. It's such a good lesson to gain in learning skills that are relevant to the overall macro trends. It's why I'm so passionate about becoming
a technologist. I can see the same exact thing happening once I am good enough to get paid to gig with tech skills. I have a feeling I have enough skills to gig now but I really want to get some
more time and practice in before really trying to get paid to do tech gigs. I think I've convinced myself that I need to start producing original content targeted to mortgage processors. 
It's a delicate area but I don't want to be on the hook for any sort of copyright infringement but the knowledge I have now in my head is my own and what I do with it is my choice. I need
to do some more research because of the private nature of the business. I look forward to bringing you more resources and knowledge for processors who may be just getting into the industry.
