# 9:29 AM 12/18/2020: I forgot how Important it was to move my body

Last night I felt inspired to pick up the ol' kettlebell and put in some physical work. I forgot how
important it was for me to physically move my body. There's a person I follow on instagram who speaks
about celebrating your body's ability to move. That really sunk in deep with me when I heard it and I wanted
to get in some work to honor myself. I've prioritized getting healthier many times through my life. It is
very much like a rollercoaster...I do well sometimes and other times I am a complete disaster. I'm sure some of
you can relate to that. At this moment in time, I definitely feel a bit heavier weight wise than I would like.
I am weighing around 217. To put that in perspective, when I was playing hockey and working out so much I was around
180-185. Not that the number is an indicator of overall health but it's one measurement we can use. I don't think
I have more muscle on my frame than fat so there's that, lol. I just want to look in the mirror and like what
I see. I want to really develop that appreciation and love for myself that I've never really had in my life.
I think it starts with honoring yourself and working every single day on the relationship you have with 
yourself. For example, I've promised myself to drink a gallon of water a day as one habit for my health. I 
haven't worked on eating better or exercising every day or whatever. I'm just tackling that one habit and
keeping the promise to myself. It's been 10 days and I genuinely feel different. Yes, the water probably has
something to do with it from a biological standpoint. But I'm arguing that the act of keeping the promise to myself
has even more weight to it psychologically. I am honoring myself. And it feels so damn good.
