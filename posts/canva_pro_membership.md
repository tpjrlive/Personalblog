# Wed Dec 30 20:25:36 EST 2020: Free Pro Membership for Canva.com if you are a non Profit

This is an amazing deal that [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is doing. They are offering a membership to their pro level if you are legitimate Non-Profit.
Our buddy James Norris with Handicapable Fitness was able to get approved for a Canva Pro membership. Great news for him and any other non-profits who had 
no idea about this. It truly is changing the graphic design game for entry level people getting into making designs for social media.
You can check out all the details at this link and apply for the program [here](https://support.canva.com/account-basics/nonprofit-program/apply-for-nonprofit/). 
Make sure you tag me in something you've created in Canva :)
