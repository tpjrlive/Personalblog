# Tue Dec 29 23:31:29 EST 2020: Documentating a 30 minute stretch

It always seems fitting to incorporate some sort of new physical goal when jumping into the new year. After 33 years, I know better than to make some grand new year new me plan for world health domination.
The number of times I've set up a goal and haven't reached it is laughable. It's like a running tape of how many times I've tried and haven't succeeded. It's just a constant little reminder always
letting me know how many times I've fell short. These are the sort of things I have to continually fight back against. I have to hold myself accountable to an optimistic plan for personal growth.
I cannot let the past failures dictate my aspirations for the future. I'm taking this advice for myself. It's one of the major reasons I work with a coach every week for developing my self esteem.
I'm not immune to feeling inadequate, or letting the destroyers of men into my brain. "I'm not worthy and I'm not enough" are just a few things that seem to find themselves into my thought process.
Well tonight, I just did a little 30 minute static stretch to help offset all the hours spent sitting in a chair now that I'm working remotely 100%. I try to take frequent standing and walking breaks.
I will tell you that my hips have never felt this stiff. It's a clear indicator I need to spend more time stretching everything out. Hope you all had a great Tuesday. Take care.
