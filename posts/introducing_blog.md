# 6:12 PM 12/13/2020: Introducing the New Daily/weekly/whenever blog

Hello and welcome! I'm so excited to get back into writing and logging my thoughts.
It was all the way back in 2010 when I started my first wordpress blog called Battleformydream.com.

This site was dedicated to helping me achieve my dream of playing professional hockey. At the time, I was a
recruited walk-on at Clarkson University and that was a serious goal of mine. Battleformydream.com was a place
for me to tell stories about other inspiring individuals to selfishly help my mindset/motivation towards
accomplishing the goal I set forth for myself.

I can't believe that was over a decade ago. I remember traveling down to Long Island for an internship after my
sophomore year of college. The 2010 World Cup was happening that year so it was an electric place to be for that.

It was with a company called Honorverus Research. I can be completely candid and say that I didn't really learn a 
whole lot with the actual internship. I felt like the big win was doing all the research/setup of my very first blog
that was through wordpress/godaddy. It was so much fun building that site even if it was just a templated blog.

I would lose hours going down different rabbit holes figuring things out about the site or how to fix something on it.

Recently, I wanted to rededicate myself to picking up Rob Muhlestein's Beginner Boost which helps aspiring technologists
receive the foundational skills needed to get started in the industry. I am also transitioning to a new day job as a 
mortgage loan processor at LoanDepot so I will be balancing a lot in the coming weeks. This basic HTML doc will serve
as the running log of thoughts/ideas/progress/wins/losses while I go through it.

One of the books he recommends for beginning Technologists is *Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics 5th Edition by Jennifer Robbins.*

I will be working through this book first. This blog will be a running experimentation log of that journey as well.
