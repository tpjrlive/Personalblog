# 11:34 PM 12/16/2020: First Week Starting a New Full-Time Job at loanDepot.

Good Wednesday Evening! It's been a pretty busy week so far as I've officially started my new full-time
position with loanDepot as a Direct Loan Processor III on 12-13-2020. I've had a blast so far getting up to speed.
I'm not going to be able to share much about my time here at loanDepot as most stuff learned will be confidential
to the company. I primarily will be dealing with analyzing mortgage loans which involves a high degree of personal 
information for borrowers. I really do enjoy the analytical nature of processing mortgage loans so I look forward to growing in the 
industry. LoanDepot has invested a tremendous amount of money in their technology which is something I'm obviously 
very passionate about. In one of their intro training videos they regarded themselves as a "Fintech" company which 
I thought was super interesting. So there it is, I now work for a "Fintech" company. I like the sounds of that
as it aligns nicely with my desire to become a technologist of some sorts in the future. 
Technology has always been a passion of mine. It means a lot for me to be aligned with a company who shares in that passion. I will be sure to keep you
updated with maybe some wins that I can talk about and more importantly maybe even a few losses that will serve as
an opportunity to learn/grow as a professional. Let's be honest in that this stream is going to be mostly dedicated
to going through hobby projects like the Learning Web Design book so that I can develop my blog/site from scratch for free.
